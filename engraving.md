## Engraving
This section presents two options for engraving details on your map. The first is placenames, which will be show as points and text labels. The second option is engraving streets, which will be shown as a series of lines. For rural areas the placenames are likely to be more suitable as there are fewer streets in remote areas. Urban areas have plenty of both types of data. Note that the placename configuration process can be a bit finicky, so if you do not enjoy detail work streets can be easier.
