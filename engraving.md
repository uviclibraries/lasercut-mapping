## Engraving
This section presents two options for engraving details on your map. The first is placenames, which will be show as points and text labels. Both Indigenous and government place names are available for use. The second option is engraving streets, which will be shown as a series of lines. For rural areas the placenames are likely to be more suitable as there are fewer streets in remote areas. Urban areas have plenty of both types of data. Note that the placename configuration process can be a bit finicky, so if you do not enjoy detail work the streets can be easier. 
## Placenames - Option 1
To get started, download [this file of Indigenous place names:](https://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/vector/geobase_cgn_toponyme/prov_shp_eng/cgn_indg_shp_eng.zip){:target="_blank"}. Right-click the packaged files and select ‘extract all’ to unzip the folder to a location within your project file. Open the data manager from the top left corner of the QGIS menu and navigate to the ‘add vector data’ option.
