## Upload files to the DSC Portal 
Well done! Your .SVG file is now ready to be exported to the DSC, where they will be cut and engraved with our laser cutter. Go to the [new job portal](https://webapp.library.uvic.ca/3dprint/customer-new-job.php){:target="_blank"} and fill out the necessary information. There are several choices for material. If you are interested in staining or painting your project, plywood is the best choice due to its light colour.<br>
